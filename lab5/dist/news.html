It’s not fair to you to keep postponing the shows, and even though it breaks my heart, it’s best that we cancel everything now until I’m really ready to be back on stage again. I want you all to know, I’m not giving up… and I can’t wait to see you again!” Dion postponed several shows in December after she announced she had been diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome, a condition, she said, that doesn’t allow her “to sing the way I’m used to.” The disorder is “a rare, progressive syndrome that affects the nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord,” according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “While we’re still learning about this rare condition, we now know this is what’s been causing all of the spasms that I’ve been having,” Dion said at the time. “Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I’m used to.” Tickets for her concerts will be refunded from their point of purchase.</p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/26/entertainment/celine-dion-tour-canceled/index.html" target="_blank">Читати повну версію</a><p>26 травень, 11:00</p></div><div class="news-box"><h3>Congress must address debt ceiling by June 5, Yellen warns</h3><p>CNN — Congress must address the debt ceiling by June 5 or the US Treasury will not have enough funds to pay all of the nation’s obligations in full and on time, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday. “Based on the most recent available data, we now estimate that Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government’s obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5,” she wrote in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The latest letter comes as President Joe Biden and House Republicans continue to try to hammer out a deal to address the debt ceiling before the US defaults on its obligations, which would wreak havoc on the global economy and financial system.</p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/26/politics/janet-yellen-debt-ceiling-default/index.html" target="_blank">Читати повну версію</a><p>26 травня, 10:57</p></div><div class="news-box"><h3 class="small-h-font">Americans to spend $1.6 billion less on gas this Memorial Day weekend</h3><p>New York CNN Business — Much like the skies, the roads will be busy this Memorial Day weekend as Americans celebrate the unofficial start of summer. More than 37 million people are expected to hit the roads this holiday weekend, up 6% from a year ago, according to AAA. Despite rising road travel, the cost of road trips is easing. Drivers across the country will be greeted by gas prices much cheaper than a year ago. The national average for regular gasoline stands at $3.57 a gallon as of Friday, according to AAA. That’s up from wintertime lows — but down by more than $1 from the year-ago average of $4.60, which was also the national average on the Friday before last Memorial Day. GasBuddy told CNN that consumer spending on gasoline will likely plunge by $1.6 billion during the four-day weekend, compared with last year. Overall, oil supply has improved, including in the United States where annual oil output is projected to hit an all-time high. So, today’s gas prices are not cheap historically. But they’re still miles away from the record high of $5.02 a gallon last June. “Those who waited to take a road trip this summer are being rewarded with big savings on gasoline,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. It’s across the board: Drivers in all 50 states are experiencing cheaper gas prices this holiday weekend, including sharp declines in California ($1.31), Alaska ($1.30), New York ($1.25), New Jersey ($1.24) and Florida ($1.22), according to GasBuddy.</p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/26/business/gas-prices-memorial-day/index.html" target="_blank">Читати повну версію</a><p>26 травня, 10:55</p></div></section><footer class="p-font">Copyright 2023.</footer></div></body></html>
